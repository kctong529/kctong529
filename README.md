# Hi there, I'm Ki Chun 👋

I’m a third-year Digital Systems and Design student at Aalto University, passionate about software development, embedded systems, and networking. I enjoy building full-stack systems that bridge hardware and software, with an eye toward usability and performance.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🔭 Working on my final project: a desktop video chat prototype using QUIC for seamless handoff between Wi-Fi and cellular networks.
- 🌱 Maintaining Sisukas, a lightweight course filtering tool with potential to become a full-fledged course planning platform with user management, branching off a couple of npm packages along the way.
- 🎵 Polishing a portable ESP32-based audio recorder: optimizing signal processing, power efficiency and custom PCB design.
- 👯 Open to collaborating on impactful projects.
- 💬 Ask me about web development, networking, embedded programming, or security.
- 📫 You can reach me at [kichun.tong@aalto.fi](mailto:kichun.tong@aalto.fi)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love playing guitar (though I’m still learning 😄).
