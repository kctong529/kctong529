# Hi there, I'm Ki Chun 👋

I'm a third-year Digital Systems and Design student at Aalto University, passionate about software development, embedded programming, and networking. Here's a quick look at what I'm working on:

## 🚀 About Me

- 🔭 Working on my final project: a prototype exploring seamless video call handover using QUIC connection migration.
- 🌱 Maintaining sisukas, a web project for my university community with a large user base (ongoing side project).
- 🎵 Polishing a portable audio recorder with ESP32 (past early prototyping): optimizing power consumption with ULP programming and designing custom PCB for size reduction.
- 👯 Open to collaborating on impactful projects.
- 💬 Ask me about web development, networking, embedded programming, or security.
- 📫 You can reach me at [kichun.tong@aalto.fi](mailto:kichun.tong@aalto.fi)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love playing guitar (though I’m still learning 😄).
