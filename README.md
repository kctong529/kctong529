# Hi there, I'm Ki Chun 👋

I’m a third-year **Digital Systems and Design** student at **Aalto University**, focused on turning real user needs into clear domain models and systems that actually solve the right problem.

## 🌱 Sisukas — Course Discovery & Planning Platform

Creator and maintainer of **Sisukas**, a production-grade course discovery and study planning system used alongside SISU at Aalto.

- Built around a planning-first domain model (Plans, Blocks, Schedule Pairs, Decision Slots)
- Models trade-offs explicitly instead of hiding them behind “optimal” schedules
- Schedule Pairs engine generates and ranks valid combinations from domain constraints
- Two-source data architecture (cached metadata + real-time schedules)
- Public APIs and a type-safe Python library
- Fully deployed system:
  - backend services, frontend, and managed database
  - CI/CD with environment isolation (dev / prod)
  - defense-in-depth security (route-level auth + database RLS)

If you care about systems that make trade-offs explicit, survive real-world constraints, and are actually deployed and maintained, feel free to take a look :)
